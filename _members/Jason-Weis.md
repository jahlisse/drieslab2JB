Jason is a second year PhD student co-advised by Ruben Dries and Sarah Mazzilli. His work will use a variety of spatially resolved multi-omic assays and computational analyses with the aim of identifying biomarkers indicative of tumorigenesis and disease progression of early lung cancer. Outside of the lab, Jason keeps himself busy with swimming and cycling.
