The Dries lab received another pilot grant from the Boston University CTSI program. 
Together with Dr. Naomi Ko from the Breast Health Center at BMC we will explore 
how accurate current approaches and technologies for mapping breast cancer 
heterogeneity within a patient are. We hope that this will help understand the
current limitations of such approaches and design the best ways to faithfully 
represent the tumor tissue of every single patient.
