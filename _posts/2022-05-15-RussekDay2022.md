The 28th Annual Henry I. Russek Student Achievement Day was held on May 6 and is an annual celebration of the work done by PhD students in the Graduate Medical Sciences Program at BUSM. This year, 3rd year Dries lab student George Chen took home a second place prize for his work generating and analyzing a 3D breast cancer dataset. George won a prize and everyone else got free lunch, so it was a great day all around.
