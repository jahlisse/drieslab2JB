The Dries lab is excited to receive a grant from the American Cancer Society (ACS) to pilot the establishment of clinical biopsy pipelines at Boston Medical Center, in collaboration with BMC, and to build the workflows and tools for applying multiplexed spatial in-situ RNA profiling (MERFISH) on primary breast cancer samples.
