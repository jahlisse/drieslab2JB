On Thursday August 11th Laila Norford and Cecilia 'Ceci' McCormick presented their summer projects at the BRITE Mini-Symposium in the Kilachand Center. Laila and Ceci both joined the Dries lab this summer as part of the [BRITE REU program](https://sites.bu.edu/britereu/). Together with graduate students in the lab they worked on intricate problems in spatial data biology and performed exceptionally well. Their presence in the Dries lab will surely be missed and we wish them all the best in their early scientific careers!
