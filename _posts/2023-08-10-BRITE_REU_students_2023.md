On Thursday August 10th Amelia Zug presented her Summer project in the Dries lab at the BRITE Mini-Symposium in the CDS building. Amelia did an amazing job, and together with members of our team, build an experimental and computational pipeline for high-throughput modeling of cellular cross-talk that is compatible with spatial multiplexing approaches.
